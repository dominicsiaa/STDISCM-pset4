# Classify

This is a distributed system for a web application for student enrollment and viewing of grades built using the ASP.NET MVC framework. 

## Running the program locally

1. Have Visual Studio installed with the .NET Desktop Environment bundle.

2. Open, build and run the "STDISCM pset4.AppHost". Doing so will orchestrate the .NET Aspire applications (nodes), resulting in them running together.

3. A dashboard showing all Resources (nodes) and their statuses should appear. To go to Classify, open the endpoint/link for the classify project.

4. To simulate downtime of certain nodes, simply click the Stop icon in the initial Resources tab of the desired node to shut down. You can turn it back on by clicking the icon again.

5. You can also view logs via the Console page of the Resources tab.

6. To close the application simply close the Terminal/Command Prompt that opens when running the AppHost file.
